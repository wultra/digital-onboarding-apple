# Language Configuration

The language of content that might be localized can be configured via `acceptLanguage` property on both `WDOActivationService` and `WDOVerificationService`.

The default language is `en`. Availability of languages depends on server configuration and implementation.

The language properties are just a wrap-around of the underlying networking language configuration described in [our networking library documentation](https://github.com/wultra/networking-apple).
