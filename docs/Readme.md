Elevate your standard device activation, user login, and request signing scenarios by incorporating facial recognition and document scanning in diverse situations:

- Reclaim access or recover lost credentials through authenticating the user's genuine presence and verifying document validity.
- Reinforce conventional password or PIN-based authentication with an extra layer of security through face recognition.
- Seamlessly onboard new customers into your systems, authenticating them with identification cards and facial scans for access to your app.
